List of current TODOs
=======================================

1. The SFML Usage is rather hacked together and should be rewritten.
   (The old API used now longer works, and mkst has only been "adapted" to the current one.)
2. Check overlay display, help screen doesn't work.
3. When changing dimensions, the application seems to freeze.
4. More HUD possibilities might be a good idea.
5. --modXY are both missing
6. The zIs* and wIs* options need more possibilities. No abs, yet?
7. Search for leaks
8. Search for race conditions
9. Transfer creation into pwxLib::CSimplexTexture
